# TONY'S RACING GAME

The story of a little brother joining the big brother and doing some codind: https://jsosaweb.wordpress.com/2017/11/23/building-a-game-with-my-brother/ 
Naturally we leaned towards building a game and the only thing that seemed feasible at the time (considering our time constraints)
was a racing game with some simple CSS animations and some JavaScript. A fun time.
